The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has given a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy companies and regional banks) that have lagged in recent quarters, and value stocks have kept up the pace with growth stocks in the past year. Now, the Federal Reserve lifting interest rates to fend off inflation, which will likely cap multiple expansion for growth companies. Regardless, the value sector is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.1%, compared to the 0.8% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF.

Two-thirds of the world will have internet access by 2023, while the number of connected devices is expected to grow to three-times the global population. IoT (machine to machine or M2M) connections are expected to grow at a 30% CAGR. Security is a top need, as \"denial of service\" attacks are set to double by 2023. To handle the challenges of managing, storing, and securing data amid this explosive traffic growth, data centers will need to harness the power of artificial intelligence. AI enhances data center capabilities though the power of machine learning, inference, and deep learning, all in an application-accelerated environment. The AI data center also makes use of non-traditional and emerging technologies that provide more computing power than traditional CPU-based architectures. These include GPU Compute from NVidia and Tensor cores from Google/Alphabet.

When the index approached 3,000 for the first time in mid-July, we reminded investors that first-time crossovers at key millennial marks frequently are followed by retracements. The S&P 500 briefly reclaimed the 3,000 summit in mid-September but could not keep its footing. Here in mid-October, stocks spent a maddening week again flirting with 3,000 but not quite crossing the threshold.",

The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy has expanded to record levels and is still growing. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would be contracting, not expanding, and capital would not be flooding into the country. A couple of statistics should help illustrate our point: Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $20.7 trillion in 2018. That's growth of 21x. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than 3x during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven in large part by innovation. In addition, the value of listed corporations on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of 2018 was approximately $31 trillion, representing 41% of global equity market capitalization, while U.S. GDP represented only 15% of global GDP.",
