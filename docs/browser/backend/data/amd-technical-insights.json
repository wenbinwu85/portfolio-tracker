            "reportTitle": "Our stock/bond asset-allocation model, which we call the Stock Bond Barometer, is now indicating that stocks are the asset class offering the most value at the current market juncture. But not by much. The model takes into account current levels and forecasts of short-term and long-term government and corporate fixed-income yields, inflation, stock prices, GDP, and corporate earnings, among other factors. The output is expressed in terms of standard deviations to the mean, or sigma. The mean reading, going back to 1960, is a modest premium for stocks, of 0.16 sigma, with a standard deviation of 0.98. The current valuation level is a 0.04 sigma discount for stocks, which is now below fair value and down sharply from a 0.85 sigma premium at the end of 3Q. Other valuation measures also show reasonable multiples for stocks. The current forward P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is approximately 18, which is within the normal range of 10-21 and down from 23 at the end of 2021.  The current S&P 500 dividend yield of 1.4%, while below the historical average of 2.9%, is up from an ultralow 1.2% also in 2021. And that current S&P 500 dividend yield is 35% of the 10-year Treasury yield, compared to the long-run average of 39% and the all-time low of 18% during 1999. We expect the results from our stock-bond valuation model to continue to improve, as interest rates head lower in 2024 and EPS growth picks up. Based in part on the output from our Stock Bond Barometer, our recommended asset allocation model for moderate accounts is 70% growth assets, including 68% equities and 2% alternatives; and 30% fixed income, with a focus on core and opportunistic segments of the bond market. On duration, we recommend focusing on the short end of the curve.",

The National Association of Home Builders said that builder sentiment was down for a fourth consecutive month in November, but housing conditions may improve in the coming months helped by a recent decline in Treasury rates. The NAHB is forecasting a 5% increase in single-family starts in 2024 as \"financial conditions ease with improving inflation data in the months ahead.\" D.R. Horton, the largest U.S. builder, could be a beneficiary. The company's fiscal 4Q orders jumped 39% even with high mortgage rates. On the company's November 7 earnings call, Chairman Donald Horton offered the following: \"The supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points remains limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable.\" DHI offered incentives to keep prices affordable and plans to continue them in 2024. The company's board showed its confidence by raising the full-year dividend by 20%. Existing-home sales for October declined 14.6% from prior-year levels to 3.79 million homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. We expect new-home sales for October to rise to 700,000 (SAAR) from 577,000 a year earlier, but decline from 759,000 in September. The S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index for September will be released on November 28. With inventories tight and unemployment low, we expect home prices to remain elevated. The Zillow Home Value Index was up 1.1% YOY in September and up 1.8% in October. In this tumultuous housing market, Argus recommends Lennar, D.R. Horton, and Toll Brothers -- companies with solid financial strength that are adapting to market conditions.",

The continued stress on the economy from higher interest rates, and questions about whether the Federal Reserve is done raising them, have weighed on valuations. Most economists are not convinced that the recession question has been answered. While there are strengths in the economy -- like the labor market and consumer spending -- inflation indicators inched up last month. The uncertain environment has impacted small-caps, mid-caps, large-caps, and even mega-caps. There is a wide range in data that shows how sectors are weathering this climate, with Communication Services up nearly 40% year-to-date but Consumer Staples down 2% for the same time period. In our opinion, some solid companies with strong financials have been oversold. For our list this week, we identified 10 BUY-rated large- or mega-cap companies across numerous industries that are selling at attractive valuations (more than 20% below their 52-week highs). They are listed according to company size, with the largest first.",

            "reportTitle": "The Federal Reserve's interest-rate campaign halted growth in the residential and manufacturing sectors, and the sky-high dollar is proving a challenge for exports. But government spending -- an important segment of the economy -- is stepping up to help the consumer sector generate GDP growth. Over the past decade, government spending has accounted for 15%-19% of overall GDP. Some of the lower rates were during the 2010s, when Congress imposed a sequestration program in exchange for an increase in the debt ceiling in 2011. Of course, spending picked up during the pandemic, as bipartisan programs flooded the economy with $4.6 trillion (according to the Government Accountability Office). We calculate that government spending, on average, has increased at a 1.7% annualized rate over the past four years. Of the three GDP components that comprise government spending, the biggest driver has been nondefense spending, which on average has risen at an 8% rate (distorted by the pandemic, of course). Defense spending has grown at a rate below 1%, though we note a sharp acceleration to 4%-5% growth since Russia invaded Ukraine. Looking ahead, Washington has just been through another debt-cap debate, and excess growth may be limited in the quarters ahead. Still, the government remains committed to the Biden infrastructure plan as well as the Chips & Science Act -- and we anticipate that government spending will continue contributing to overall GDP growth.",

We review the 13Fs of the major activist investors, including Carl Icahn, Trian Fund Management, Jana Partners and ValueAct Holdings, among others, in order to determine their core holdings and new purchases. Activist investing has evolved in recent years and is now less about generating a short-term return on an underpriced stock and more about achieving long-term returns through an active management/investor partnership. Activists have made progress in the past year with high-profile investments into blue-chip companies such as FedEx Inc. and Union Pacific.

Performance was led by last year's laggard sectors, including Communication Services and Technology. Last year's top-performing sector, Energy, was the worst in 1Q23. Financial Services, including banks, were not far ahead.  The average stock in the Argus Universe of Coverage rose 4% in the quarter; the median stock advanced 2%. The average BUY-rated stock rose 5.4% and the average HOLD-rated stock gained 3.4%. Recently, we raised our sector rating on Technology to Over-Weight, and expect outperformance into 2Q -- especially if interest rates head lower. We also raised our rating on Financial Services, and the bottom five stocks in our list point to potential value opportunities.",

When stock values pull back, especially far back, it usually is not a good time for investors to retreat. Rather, we advise that shareholders look for companies with strong managements, desirable products or services, and solid track records. For this week's list, we did exactly that in beaten-down Technology. We used the Argus Research Screening Tool and applied the following criteria: the stocks must be in the Technology sector; must be rated BUY at Argus; must carry an Argus Financial Strength rating of Medium-High or High; and must trade at least 30% below their 52-week high.

            "reportTitle": "Explosive growth in mobile and fixed-line traffic is driving demand for robust data centers that are enabled for artificial intelligence (AI) and can manage rising and increasingly-complex traffic flow. Two-thirds of the world will have internet access by 2023, while the number of connected devices is expected to grow to three-times the global population. IoT (machine to machine or M2M) connections are expected to grow at a 30% CAGR. Security is a top need, as \"denial of service\" attacks are set to double by 2023. To handle the challenges of managing, storing, and securing data amid this explosive traffic growth, data centers will need to harness the power of artificial intelligence. AI enhances data center capabilities though the power of machine learning, inference, and deep learning, all in an application-accelerated environment. The AI data center also makes use of non-traditional and emerging technologies that provide more computing power than traditional CPU-based architectures. These include GPU Compute from NVidia and Tensor cores from Google/Alphabet. As of mid-year 2021, about 600 hyperscale data centers were in operation around the world, up from about 500 at year-end 2019 and double the number from five years ago. The bulk of data center construction is by hyperscale providers including AWS from Amazon.com, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud from Alphabet, as well as with Chinese companies including Baidu and Alibaba. Co-location companies are another major data center driver, including Equinix and Digital Realty Trust. International Business Machines is providing hybrid cloud services that bridge public and private clouds. Other data center suppliers include semiconductor companies Broadcom, Marvell Technology, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices. Stocks on the Argus Research BUY list that are in position to benefit include the following.",

He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. But the performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.",
