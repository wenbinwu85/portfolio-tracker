But in an environment of historically low interest rates (and with the coronavirus and a high unemployment rate seemingly poised to keep them low for a long time), many investors are searching for high levels of income, often be found in value stocks. During recent years, the performance record has favored growth. Since 2010, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed more than 400%, compared to an advance of 200% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In eight of the past 10 years, growth stocks topped value. That hasn't always been the case. In the previous decade, including the Great Recession, value stocks were better performers, advancing a low 8%, but still better than growth, which declined 15%. Value investors trace their roots to the famous \"Security Analysis\" textbook, written by Ben Graham, an economics professor at Columbia University. The tide may now be turning. Progress on COVID-19 vaccines has given a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy companies and banks) that have lagged in recent quarters, and value stocks have kept pace with growth stocks in the past quarter. In any event, value is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.5%, compared to the 1.0% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF. This is not unimportant, as the current yield on the 10-year Treasury bond is 0.95%.

But we also look for companies with clean balance sheets, high levels of profitability, cash-flow generation, and an experienced management teams. We seek to avoid companies in industries that are in secular decline, or with dividend yields that are so high that the payout is clearly at risk. To us, right now, that level is 8%-9%-plus. That said, many value companies may face a substantial near-term industry problem.

            "reportTitle": "Growth stocks may be outperforming value, again, in 2020. But in an environment of historically low interest rates (and with the coronavirus and economic shutdown seemingly poised to keep them low for a long time), many investors are still searching for high levels of income, which can often be found in value stocks. When we look for attractive high-yield/value stocks at Argus, we look for low valuations on metrics such as price/earnings, price/sales, price/book, yield and price/cash flow. But we also look for companies with clean balance sheets, high levels of profitability, cash-flow generation, and an experienced management teams. We seek to avoid companies in industries that are in secular decline, or with dividend yields that are so high that the payout is clearly at risk. To us, right now, that level is 8%-9%-plus. That said, many value companies may face a substantial near-term industry problem. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have designed a portfolio of companies followed by Argus Research analysts that are BUY-rated on a long-term (five-year) basis, have a Financial Strength rating of at least Medium, and have a yield of 3.5% or higher.",

But in an environment of historically low interest rates (and with the Federal Reserve seemingly poised to cut again), many investors are still searching for high levels of income, which can often be found in value stocks. Over the years, the performance record has favored growth. Since 2003, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed 457%, compared to an advance of 289% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In 11 of the 16 years of this period, growth stocks have topped value stocks. Still, value is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.9%, compared to the 1.4% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF. As well, sometimes the risk profile favors value. For the past five years, the standard deviation of monthly returns for value stocks has been 3.5%, compared to the 3.7% standard deviation of monthly returns for growth stocks. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have designed a portfolio of companies followed by Argus Research that are BUY- or HOLD-rated on a long-term (five-year) basis and have an average yield of 4.0% or higher. The portfolio includes 40 stocks and representation in all 11 sectors. Not surprisingly, the weights of the sectors are different from the current weights in the S&P 500. As an example, the Argus High-Yield Portfolio has a 15% weighting in Energy, 13% in Consumer Staples and 8% in both Real Estate and Utilities. These are all Over-Weights compared to the broad market. Under-Weighted sectors include Technology (only 3% of the Argus High-Yield Portfolio) and Industrial (5%). The average yield for the portfolio is 4.97%, compared to 1.85% for the S&P 500.

Over the years, the performance record has favored Growth. Since 2003, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed 423%, compared to an advance of 278% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In 10 of the 15 years of this period, Growth stocks have topped Value stocks. Still, Value is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.2%, compared to the current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF of 1.1%. As well, sometimes the risk profile favors Value. For the past five years, the standard deviation of monthly returns for Value stocks has been 2.83%, compared to the standard deviation of monthly returns for Growth stocks of 2.93%. When we look for Value at Argus, we look for low valuations on metrics such as price/earnings, price/sales, price/book, yield and price/cash flow. But we also look for companies with clean balance sheets, high levels of profitability and cash flow generation capability, and experienced management teams.",

            "reportTitle": "Growth stocks may be outperforming in 2018 -- but in an environment of historically low interest rates, many investors are still searching for high levels of income, which can often be found in Value stocks. Over the years, the performance record has favored Growth. Since 2003, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed 423%, compared to an advance of 278% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In 10 of the 15 years of this period, Growth stocks have topped Value stocks. Still, Value is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.2%, compared to the current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF of 1.1%. As well, sometimes the risk profile favors Value. For the past five years, the standard deviation of monthly returns for Value stocks has been 2.83%, compared to the standard deviation of monthly returns for Growth stocks of 2.93%. When we look for Value at Argus, we look for low valuations on metrics such as price/earnings, price/sales, price/book, yield and price/cash flow. But we also look for companies with clean balance sheets, high levels of profitability and cash flow generation capability, and experienced management teams.",
