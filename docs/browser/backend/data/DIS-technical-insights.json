The continued stress on the economy from higher interest rates, and questions about whether the Federal Reserve is done raising them, have weighed on valuations. Most economists are not convinced that the recession question has been answered. While there are strengths in the economy -- like the labor market and consumer spending -- inflation indicators inched up last month. The uncertain environment has impacted small-caps, mid-caps, large-caps, and even mega-caps. There is a wide range in data that shows how sectors are weathering this climate, with Communication Services up nearly 40% year-to-date but Consumer Staples down 2% for the same time period. In our opinion, some solid companies with strong financials have been oversold. For our list this week, we identified 10 BUY-rated large- or mega-cap companies across numerous industries that are selling at attractive valuations (more than 20% below their 52-week highs).

We like to review the 13Fs of major activist investors, including Carl Icahn, Trian Fund Management, Jana Partners, and ValueAct Holdings, among others, in order to determine their core holdings and new purchases.  Activist investing has evolved in recent years and is now less about generating a short-term return on an underpriced stock and more about achieving long-term returns through an active management/investor partnership.  Activists have made progress in the past year with high-profile investments into companies such as Fedex and Union Pacific.  According to Vickers, here are some recent new purchases and key holdings of activist investors, as well as other high-profile money managers such as Warren Buffet of Berkshire Hathaway and Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors LLC.",

The smoothed growth rate is 7% and the P/E ratio is 21x. The sector accounts for 11% of the S&P 500. We think investors should consider allocating 12%-14% of diversified portfolios to the sector.

We have raised the Communication Services sector to Over-Weight from Market-Weight. We have also raised the Energy and Real Estate sectors to Market-Weight from Under-Weight. Finally, we have lowered the Utilities sector to Under-Weight from Over-Weight and the Consumer Staples sector to Under-Weight from Market-Weight. The rebalancing process takes place four times a year, early in the months of March, June, September, and December. Our current Over-Weight sectors are Technology, Healthcare, Financial Services, Industrial and Communication Services.  Our current Market-Weight sectors are Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Real Estate and Basic Materials. Our Under-Weight sectors are Utilities and Consumer Staples. Argus suggests that investors use this process to tweak weightings within their balanced equity portfolios in order to take advantage of valuation imbalances.",

Simultaneously, internet giants Alphabet and Facebook are acting as forums for community concerns about the coronavirus. The style mix of the sector is approximately one-third \"value\" and two-thirds \"growth.\" The adjusted pro-forma beta is approximately 1.0 (like the old Telecoms), while the yield is 0.9% (reflecting the impact of Google and Facebook).  The smoothed growth rate is 7% and the P/E ratio is 21-times. The sector accounts for 11% of the S&P 500.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5% and the S&P 500 added 0.3%, closing at a record high. As third-quarter earnings announcements began to wind down in a better-than-expected fashion, stocks also maintained momentum for the week, leading to a fifth consecutive rise. The Dow was up 1.2%, the Nasdaq added 1.1%, and the S&P 500 rose 0.9%. Year-to-date gains are now 18.7% for the Dow, 27.7% for the Nasdaq and 23.4% for the S&P 500.  ",
