As well, a measured move based on the small head-and-shoulders top came in at 3,910. A 61.8% giveback for the Nasdaq was 11,564 (last week's low was 11,547), and for the QQQs, the same retrace targeted 293.84 (with the intraday low last week at 293).",

Of late, stock investors had it very good for a very long time -- but now, finding opportunities requires much more work. There is no secret sauce, but there are principals that are worth reviewing: 1) diversify; 2) look for strong management; 3) look for solid balance sheets; 4) do your homework; and 5) adapt. To assemble this week's list, we looked across several sectors that historically are considered to be the most-shielded from high inflation and high interest rates. We then cross-referenced our coverage universe for companies where our analysts recently raised target prices; that have an Argus Financial Strength rating of at least Medium-High; and that pay dividends of least 3%. Some companies also are featured in our model portfolios (Growth & Income, Equity Income, Growth, and Institutional).

Energy accounts for 3.6% of S&P 500 market cap; over the past five years, the weighting has ranged from 2% to 10%. We think investors should consider allocating 4%-5% of diversified portfolios to the group. The sector is outperforming thus far in 2022, with a gain of 32.3%. It also outperformed in 2021, with a gain of 47.7%. It underperformed in 2020, with a loss of 37.3%, and in 2019, with a gain of 7.6%.

When the market carnage first started, corporate insiders looked the massive selling right in the eyes and responded by buying. Now, with the stock-market decline gaining momentum, insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research again shows that insiders are gobbling up shares. As well, the volume of insider transactions is very high, giving additional weight to the sentiment that comes from those transactions. Vickers' Total One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is now 1.35, very positive on a scale where anything below 2.00 is bullish. Vickers' Total eight-week moving is now 2.88, and has improved from 4.76 a mere two weeks ago. We acknowledge that (most) insiders are not doctors and their current enthusiasm in no way reflects an imminent end to the coronavirus. But assuming this health crisis follows the same path to resolution as those that came before it, insiders seem to see current value in stocks.",
