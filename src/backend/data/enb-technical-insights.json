            "reportTitle": "The Federal Reserve's favorite inflation indicator, the PCE Price Index, will be released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) this morning. The PCE differs from the better-known Consumer Price Index (CPI) in that its composition is changed more frequently and is quicker to reflect the impact of real-time pricing fluctuations. In the most-recent report, through December, PCE inflation was reported at 2.6% (the latest CPI report, through January, had inflation at 3.1%). Core PCE, which removes volatile food and energy prices, was 2.9% in the latest month, down from 3.2% in the prior month. Our forecasts call for 2.3% for the headline number and 2.8% for the core reading. Overall, inflation in this cycle peaked in summer 2022 and has been on a downward trek, though the rate of decline is stalling. We track 20 inflation measures on a monthly basis. On average, they currently indicate that prices are rising at a 2.55% rate year-over-year, down slightly from 2.61% a month ago.  The numbers are distorted somewhat by a sharp decline in Producer Price Intermediate Goods, which are falling at a 15% rate and likely point to easing prices across the inflation spectrum in the months ahead.  Focusing on core inflation -- which we obtain by averaging Core CPI, market-based PCE Ex-Food & Energy, the core GDP PCE Price Index, the five-year forward inflation expectation rate and  the 10-year TIPs Break-even Interest Rate -- our reading is 2.67%, down seven basis points month-over-month. That's lower largely because, at long last, sticky prices like shelter and transportation are starting to ease. Investors are expecting that the Federal Reserve's series of rate hikes ultimately will tame inflation, with the five-year forward expectation rate at 2.26%.",

That's a recent rarity, as for more than a decade, the performance record favored growth. Since 2010, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed more than 575%, compared to an advance of almost 200% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In 10 of the past 13 years, growth stocks have topped value stocks.  That hasn't always been the case. In the 2000-2010 decade, including the Great Recession, value stocks were better performers than growth stocks, advancing an admittedly low 8% (but still better than growth, which declined 15% during the decade). Value investors trace their roots to the famous \"Security Analysis\" textbook, written by Ben Graham, an economics professor at Columbia University.  Warren Buffett was one of his students. Why the recent deviation in performance? Several reasons, including changes in the make-up of the economy, growth in intangible assets, and the current level of interest rates. But the tide turned back in 2022, at least for a while, as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines gave a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy and regional banks) that had lagged in recent years. While growth stocks have recaptured the lead since 2023, the Federal Reserve continues to keep interest rates high to fend off inflation.

            "reportTitle": "Alternative investments often are added to diversified portfolios in order to hedge against stock- and bond-market weakness, and reduce the riskiness of overall portfolio returns. At least that's what the textbooks say. Real-time market performance can often be another matter. Of all the alternatives in the marketplace, oil and gold often zig when the broad U.S. equity market zags, and can serve as relatively dependable alternative options. For example, in 2022, the S&P 500 plunged 19% while oil prices rose 4% and gold was steady. Last year was a strong year for stocks, and oil tumbled. Of course, there are years when all move in lockstep, such as 2019, when the three assets increased in the range of 20%-30%. For our asset allocation models in our Investment Portfolio Guide, we typically have alternatives constitute up to 2%-4% of the portfolios. And, given the early stage of the current equity bull market, we recommend an under-weighting in alternatives. While we still think it is early to be adding volatile Bitcoin-related securities to our model portfolios, we are encouraged about the long-term opportunities for blockchain technology. Though performing well this year, Bitcoin lost 65% in 2022. That stings. We will re-consider an exposure to cryptocurrencies once the sector approaches total market capitalization of $5 trillion, or when the regulatory outlook becomes clearer.",

While the S&P 500 has jumped almost 11% in the past month, the EAFA index of large- and mid-cap stocks based in countries other than the U.S. and Canada has risen 10%. Over the past six years, the performance gap has been wider, with the S&P 500 advancing 12% compared to a 7% gain for the EAFE. But the underperformance has given global stocks a valuation advantage, particularly in the area of dividends. The EAFE dividend yield of 2.4% is 80 basis points higher than the comparable S&P 500 dividend yield. We think global dividend stocks now offer opportunity, particularly given the endless speculation over the direction of interest rates in the U.S., which has created market-timing headaches for equity income investors. Those investors have endured recent wide swings in prices for rate-sensitive equity sectors such as Utilities, REITs and MLPs. In our view, investing in international income stocks is one way to increase portfolio diversification while reducing sensitivity to volatile U.S interest rates. Investing in overseas stocks carries its own set of risks, including the impact of currency exchange and geopolitical turmoil. But there are also a number of positives in this asset class for U.S. investors, including a wide selection of companies that pay dividends, robust industry diversification, and, as we have mentioned, higher yields and lower valuations. Argus has recently boosted its global coverage, and recommends the following international dividend stocks, each of which has at least a long-term HOLD rating from an Argus analyst.",

            "reportTitle": "Global stocks are on a run. While the S&P 500 has jumped almost 8% year-to-date, The EAFA Index of large- and mid-cap stocks based in countries other than the U.S. and Canada has risen 9%.  Over the past six months, foreign stocks also have outperformed, climbing 11% versus a 1% decline by the U.S. market. The story is different over the past five years, as the S&P 500 has risen 50% and global stocks have fallen 1%. Even so, the long outperformance has given global stocks a valuation advantage, particularly in the area of dividends. The EAFE dividend yield of 2.7% is 100 basis points higher than the comparable S&P 500 dividend yield. We think global dividend stocks now offer opportunity, particularly given the endless speculation over the direction of interest rates in the U.S., which has created market-timing headaches for equity income investors - who have endured recent wide swings in prices for rate-sensitive equity sectors such as utilities, REITs and MLPs. In our view, investing in international income stocks is one way to increase portfolio diversification while reducing sensitivity to volatile U.S. interest rates. Investing in overseas stocks carries its own set of risks, including the impact of currency exchange and geopolitical turmoil. But there are also a number of positives in this asset class for U.S. investors, including a wide selection, robust industry diversification, and, as we have mentioned, higher yields and lower valuations. Argus recently boosted its global coverage, and recommends the following international dividend stocks, each of which has at least a long-term BUY rating from an Argus analyst. This list of approximately 25 companies offers exposure to eight of the 11 major industrial sectors.  The list includes companies from 10 countries.",

We note that investors exit the stock market at their own peril, as long-term returns from equities consistently have outpaced long-term returns from other asset classes, such as fixed income and cash. As well, those fixed-income returns are from eras when the 10-year Treasury bond yield was much higher than the current 3.5% level. So what's a potential equity strategy for investors amid all the uncertainty? Argus believes that Min Vol is an all-weather strategy that is timely in any investing climate.",

In September, jobs gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, healthcare, construction, and manufacturing. The retail industry was relatively steady in terms of employment.  The employment report, though lower month-over-month, suggests that the consumer segment of the economy is likely to remain on a growth track, despite the impact of the Federal Reserve rate hikes, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and high prices at the gas pump. There were few signs that inflation is likely to cool.

            "reportTitle": "Dividends are supposed to lend stability to a portfolio. However, U.S.-based income investors have experienced a high degree of volatility in recent years, as the Federal Reserve since 2018 has embarked on two campaigns to raise interest rates, sandwiched around a desperate program that lowered the federal funds rate to zero in order to help the economy recover from the pandemic. The endless speculation over the direction of rates has created market-timing headaches for equity income investors. They have endured wide swings in prices for rate-sensitive equity sectors such as Utilities, REITs and MLPs. In our view, investing in international income stocks is one way to increase portfolio diversification while reducing sensitivity to volatile U.S interest rates. Investing in overseas stocks carries its own set of risks, including the impact of currency exchange and geopolitical turmoil. But there are also a number of positives in this asset class for U.S. investors, including a wide selection, robust industry diversification, higher yields, and lower valuations. Argus has recently boosted its global coverage, and recommends the following international dividend stocks. Note this list of 25 companies offers exposure to eight of the 11 major sectors. The list includes companies from 10 countries.",

Turning to other data points, the unemployment rate was steady at 3.6%, and the number of unemployed persons was 5.9 million, down from 6.0 million in the prior month. Average hourly earnings increased 10 cents month-to-month and are now 5.1% higher year-over-year, compared to 5.2% a month ago and 5.5% two months ago. Revisions to the jobs totals from the two prior months subtracted 74,000 jobs from the economy. In June, jobs gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, healthcare, and transportation and warehousing. The report indicates that the consumer segment of the economy is likely to remain on a growth track, despite the impact of the Federal Reserve rate hikes, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and higher prices at the gas pump.

In some decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for 15%-20% of returns. Still, in 2018, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. The pattern is being repeated in 2022 as well.

We anticipate a trading range of $140-$80 for the year. The current price is around $110, up from $75 at the beginning of the year but down from $123 in early March. The core drivers behind oil prices in the near term are global demand and global supply. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, there was a supply shortage last year: global consumption was 97.4 million barrels per day, while global production was only 95.6 million barrels. This was a reversal from 2020, when global demand was 91.9 million bb/day and production was 93.8.  As a result, the average price of oil was $40 in 2020. In addition to the near-term drivers, there are geopolitical developments, ranging from wars (Russia's invasion of Ukraine) to sanctions (Iran, Venezuela). These wild cards can cause prices to fluctuate dramatically.  Forecasts call for supply to match demand later in 2022 and to exceed demand slightly in 2023. Absent wild cards, the demand-supply outlook suggests the days of sharp increases in oil prices are in the rear-view mirror.",

Of late, stock investors had it very good for a very long time -- but now, finding opportunities requires much more work. There is no secret sauce, but there are principals that are worth reviewing: 1) diversify; 2) look for strong management; 3) look for solid balance sheets; 4) do your homework; and 5) adapt. To assemble this week's list, we looked across several sectors that historically are considered to be the most-shielded from high inflation and high interest rates. We then cross-referenced our coverage universe for companies where our analysts recently raised target prices; that have an Argus Financial Strength rating of at least Medium-High; and that pay dividends of least 3%. Some companies also are featured in our model portfolios (Growth & Income, Equity Income, Growth, and Institutional). Here is our list of companies we believe to be recession-proof, all of which are rated BUY at Argus.",

Already strong demand for petroleum products (related to global reopening) is now exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, which has led to broad sanctions on Russia and may exclude this major supplier from the global energy markets.

Energy accounts for 3.6% of S&P 500 market cap; over the past five years, the weighting has ranged from 2% to 10%. We think investors should consider allocating 4%-5% of diversified portfolios to the group. The sector is outperforming thus far in 2022, with a gain of 32.3%. It also outperformed in 2021, with a gain of 47.7%. It underperformed in 2020, with a loss of 37.3%, and in 2019, with a gain of 7.6%.

For the past decade, the performance record has favored growth. Since 2010, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed more than 600%, compared to an advance of 300% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In nine of the past 10 years, growth stocks have topped value stocks. That hasn't always been the case. In the 2000-2010 decade, including the Great Recession, value stocks were better performers than growth stocks, advancing an admittedly low 8% -- but still better than growth, which declined 15% during the decade. Value investors trace their roots to the famous \"Security Analysis\" textbook, written by Ben Graham, an economics professor at Columbia University. Warren Buffett was one of his students. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has given a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy firms and regional banks) that have lagged in recent quarters, and value stocks have kept up the pace with growth stocks in the past year.  Now, the Federal Reserve is poised to lift interest rates to fend off high inflation, which will likely cap multiple expansion for growth companies. In any event, value is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 1.6%, compared to the 0.5% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF. For our list this week, we screened our coverage universe for stocks that are BUY-rated by Argus Research analysts, have a Financial Strength rating of at least Medium, and have a yield of 3.0% or higher.

Revisions to the two prior months added another 92,000 jobs to the economy. In February, jobs gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, which points toward strength in consumer spending on services; professional and business services; healthcare; construction; and transportation and warehousing, which may ultimately help relieve the current supply-chain challenges. The report indicates that the economy remains on a growth track, despite the impact of the Omicron variant. The even better economic news was that wage growth slowed a bit.",

Canada's central bank (The Bank of Canada) is expected to begin raising interest rates soon, with three rate hikes forecast for 2022, according to the Conference Board of Canada. Meanwhile, oil prices have reached seven-year highs, pushed upward by strong demand from recovering economies, a lack of investment in new drilling projects, and the recent threat of conflict between Russia and the Ukraine. With the Financial and Energy sectors together accounting for nearly half of Canada's TSX 60 market weight, the above has (not surprisingly) led to clear outperformance for the index -- which has risen 20% over the past year versus 12% for the S&P 500. We also note that the Canadian dollar continues to trade stronger than its five-year average against the U.S. dollar, making translated earnings from Canadian companies more valuable and helping valuations.

Since then, short-term rates have moved higher -- but the long end of the curve has hardly budged on future growth concerns due to the Omicron variant. The yield curve (two-year/10-year spread) has flattened from 91 basis points on December 1 to 71 basis points at month-end. For 2022, the market is now pricing in at least three rate hikes beginning in the spring. Meanwhile, the central bank's balance sheet continues to grow, topping the $8.76 trillion mark at the end of December from $7.3 trillion at the beginning of the year and $4 trillion pre-pandemic. The balance sheet consists of $6.1 trillion of U.S. Treasuries and $2.6 trillion in agency mortgage-backed securities. We expect the balance sheet to be under $8.9 trillion once tapering is completed. Future balance-sheet reductions may be a proxy for raising rates and intended to keep the yield curve steeper. We now expect the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yield to range between 1.4% and 2.85% in 2022. We anticipate that the Federal Reserve will hike short-term interest rates three times in 2022 and two or three times in 2023, before moving to the sidelines once the federal funds rate approaches 1.75%-2.00% in 2024.",

            "reportTitle": "This is among our most-important themes for 2022, and stretches across industries. We think companies that raise their dividends consistently at a double-digit rate are sending off three important signals amid all the recent market volatility: 1) the company's balance sheet is strong enough to pay a dividend; 2) management is focused on providing shareholder returns; and 3) management is confident enough in the near-term outlook to raise the payout aggressively. This third factor is especially important as the pandemic upends the nation's recent record of long-term economic growth. Here are 12 stocks that meet our double-digit dividend test and are on the Argus BUY list. They are also holdings in our Dividend Growth Separately Managed Account and in the Dividend Growers Total Return Trust, sponsored by SmartTrust.",

            "reportTitle": "Often overlooked amid gyrations in the stock market is dividend income, which is an important element of total return. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for 15%-20% of returns. Still, in 2018, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. But not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.",

We anticipate a trading range of $50-$85 for the year. The current price is around $80, toward the high end of the range. Our estimates assume OPEC and OPEC+ members continue to coordinate on production, and that global economic activity gradually improves into 2022. At the same time, our target also takes into account the long-term downward pressure on crude prices as Peak Oil approaches. Here are the recent average annual prices: $40 in 2020, $57 in 2019, $65 in 2018, $51 in 2017, $43 in 2016, $49 in 2015, $93 in 2014 and $98 in 2013. As well, we anticipate that President Biden's policies will continue to favor clean energy rather than carbon-based energy solutions. Our target price and range through 2022 are now $70, with $85 on the upside and $60 on the downside. Our investment rating on the Energy sector is Market-Weight. The U.S. rig-count trend remains supportive and valuations are attractive. Yet energy companies may be forced to cut production as more electric vehicles are introduced by mainstream automotive OEMs, and as utilities redouble efforts to add renewable generation sources. The current weight for the sector in the S&P 500 is approximately 3.0%, down from the 12% range in 2010. Within the group, we favor companies with strong balance sheets and a history of growing dividends.",

When we look for attractive high-yield/deep-value stocks at Argus, we look for low valuations on metrics such as price/earnings, price/sales, price/book, yield, and price/cash flow. We also look for companies with clean balance sheets, high levels of profitability, high-quality earnings, and experienced management teams. We seek to avoid companies in industries that are in secular decline, or with dividend yields that are so high that the payout is clearly at risk. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have designed a portfolio of companies that are BUY-rated at Argus Research, have a Financial Strength rating of at least Medium, and have a yield of 3.0% or higher.",

The Canadian unemployment rate now stands at 7.8%, down from 8.2% in May. Seeing a more-robust economy and a Business Outlook Survey that recently hit an all-time high, the Bank of Canada is expected to taper asset purchases by another C$1 billion per week as of mid-July, this after being the first G7 country to begin tapering in April. Economists now expect the Canadian central bank to unwind its asset purchases completely by year-end, before the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to begin its tapering. Meanwhile, the sharp rebound in oil prices over the past year has been a boon for the country's Energy sector, a major contributor to the resource-heavy Canadian economy.

In some decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for 15%-20% of returns. Still, in 2018, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates.

Our revised estimate assumes OPEC and OPEC+ members continue to coordinate on production cuts of 9.6 million barrels per day, and on gradually improving economic activity through the rest of 2020. Our target price also reflects the long-term downtrend for crude prices as Peak Oil approaches.

Our range through 2021 is now $50 on the upside and $30 on the downside. Given the volatility in oil prices, our investment recommendation on the Energy sector is now Under-Weight.  The current weight for the sector in the S&P 500 is approximately 2.5%, down from the 7%-8% range in 2013-2014.
