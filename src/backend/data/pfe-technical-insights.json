That's a recent rarity, as for more than a decade, the performance record favored growth. Since 2010, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed more than 575%, compared to an advance of almost 200% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In 10 of the past 13 years, growth stocks have topped value stocks.  That hasn't always been the case. In the 2000-2010 decade, including the Great Recession, value stocks were better performers than growth stocks, advancing an admittedly low 8% (but still better than growth, which declined 15% during the decade). Value investors trace their roots to the famous \"Security Analysis\" textbook, written by Ben Graham, an economics professor at Columbia University.  Warren Buffett was one of his students. Why the recent deviation in performance? Several reasons, including changes in the make-up of the economy, growth in intangible assets, and the current level of interest rates. But the tide turned back in 2022, at least for a while, as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines gave a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy and regional banks) that had lagged in recent years. While growth stocks have recaptured the lead since 2023, the Federal Reserve continues to keep interest rates high to fend off inflation. This could possibly cap multiple expansion for growth companies in coming quarters. In any event, the value sector is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.0%, compared to the 0.7% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF.

We examined how much the actual return of an investment might exceed its expected return based on its risk level.  We asked our Certified Market Technician Mark Arbeter to study charts for technical signals that favor individual stocks and predict their alpha. Mark reported that it is difficult to find strong technical setups at this time. Still, he looked for stocks that have been beaten down but show evidence that the worst is over. Technical characteristics for these stocks include an existing intermediate- to long-term downtrend, capitulatory volume during weakness followed by an upside reversal, bullish daily and weekly momentum divergences, and (most importantly) signs that the stock is at least attempting to trace out a bottoming pattern. Mark looks for these bottom formations in certain trading patterns. Here's a list of Argus Research BUY-rated stocks that fit Mark's technical model, signally possibly upside ahead.",

The continued stress on the economy from higher interest rates, and questions about whether the Federal Reserve is done raising them, have weighed on valuations. Most economists are not convinced that the recession question has been answered. While there are strengths in the economy -- like the labor market and consumer spending -- inflation indicators inched up last month. The uncertain environment has impacted small-caps, mid-caps, large-caps, and even mega-caps. There is a wide range in data that shows how sectors are weathering this climate, with Communication Services up nearly 40% year-to-date but Consumer Staples down 2% for the same time period. In our opinion, some solid companies with strong financials have been oversold. For our list this week, we identified 10 BUY-rated large- or mega-cap companies across numerous industries that are selling at attractive valuations (more than 20% below their 52-week highs). They are listed according to company size, with the largest first.",

Even bond prices were lower last year. Stocks have recovered thus far in 2023, but gains have been largely driven by only a handful of high-tech companies.  Inflation remains high and the Fed continues to raise rates.  Is a recession in the offing?  With all the uncertainty, is it time for investors to cash in their chips? We note that investors exit the stock market at their own peril, as long-term returns from equities consistently have outpaced long-term returns from other asset classes, such as fixed income and cash. Argus believes that Min Vol is an all-weather strategy that is timely in any investing climate. Academic literature and, more to the point, returns history, indicate that Min Vol can deliver market-matching returns on an absolute basis and superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis over various time periods.",

Healthcare was an outperformer in 2022, falling only 4% while the S&P 500 dropped 19%, but has lagged in the early weeks of 2023. We think the recent relative weakness may offer a buying opportunity. Post-COVID, consumers are more willing to spend on lifestyle enhancements along with necessary spending on life-saving treatments. In addition, the survival of the Affordable Care Act has kept the ranks of insured U.S. citizens above the historical average, further increasing consumer spending on healthcare services and products. Meanwhile, companies with experience in diagnostic testing, vaccines, and antiviral medicines, as well as suppliers of protective equipment and other hospital products, have benefited from efforts to contain the pandemic. The sector accounts for 14.7% of the S&P 500, and includes companies in the pharmaceuticals, medical devices, healthcare services, and insurance industries.

Even bond prices were lower last year. Volatility, which has dropped from the highs of 2020, still has not returned to pre-COVID levels. Is it time for investors to cash in their chips? We note that investors exit the stock market at their own peril, as long-term returns from equities consistently have outpaced long-term returns from other asset classes, such as fixed income and cash. As well, those fixed-income returns are from eras when the 10-year Treasury bond yield was much higher than the current 3.5% level. So what's a potential equity strategy for investors amid all the uncertainty? Argus believes that Min Vol is an all-weather strategy that is timely in any investing climate.",

It is innovative, can be either growth or value, and can involve start-ups or mature companies. A healthcare company can be built around one product that is leveraged in broad and creative ways, or a company with depth, breadth and products that have many touchpoints. Many of the companies are truly science-based, some with managers who are stronger as scientists than as executives running a company; others have scientists focus on science while practiced managers mind the books. The Healthcare sector accounts for 15% of the S&P 500, with an overall market cap of $1.4 trillion dollars. Subsectors include Biotechnology, Healthcare Distributors, Healthcare Equipment, Healthcare Supplies, Life Sciences Tools and Services, Managed Healthcare, and Pharmaceuticals. We think investors should Over-Weight the sector and consider allocating about 15% of their diversified portfolios to stocks in the sector. Healthcare is slightly outperforming the S&P 500 thus far in 2022, with a loss of 14% compared to the 25% loss for the S&P 500. The following are some Argus BUY-rated Healthcare companies. The stocks were selected using the Argus screening tool and the following criteria: BUY-rated; large-cap (greater than $8 billion market capitalization); a Financial Strength rating of Medium-High or High; and paying a dividend. We feel these companies currently are best in class for the sector. Some are also part of our model portfolios (Growth & Income, Equity Income, Growth, and Institutional).",

Indeed, for the past decade, the performance record has favored growth. In nine of the past 10 years, growth stocks have topped value stocks. But the tide may be turning. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has given a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy companies and regional banks) that have lagged in recent quarters, and value stocks have kept up the pace with growth stocks in the past year. Now, the Federal Reserve lifting interest rates to fend off inflation, which will likely cap multiple expansion for growth companies. Regardless, the value sector is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.1%, compared to the 0.8% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF.

The Dow fell 0.4%, the S&P 0.4%, and the Nasdaq 0.3%. Crude oil traded near $101 per barrel, while gold fell $13 to $1845 per ounce.",

But there are risks, especially if the Fed moves too quickly to raise rates. The domestic employment environment is nearing full strength, although consumer confidence trends are mixed.  Auto sales have recovered from pandemic lows, but at an uneven pace. The U.S. housing market has aided the economic recovery from the pandemic; while high prices have cooled the market a bit, many metrics remain positive. The risk here is that the Fed moves too fast and the consumer sector stalls. Businesses are expanding, but growth is slowing somewhat. Exports are under pressure from the geopolitical tensions in Europe and the rising dollar. But import growth will not continue at the recent high-teens pace. Government spending trends should smooth out as well. Rolling all the data up, our GDP growth forecast in 2022 is now 2.2%, down from our prior forecast of 2.8%.  Our estimates are a bit lower than those of other forecasters.",

There is no secret sauce, but there are principals that are worth reviewing: 1) diversify; 2) look for strong management; 3) look for solid balance sheets; 4) do your homework; and 5) adapt. To assemble this week's list, we looked across several sectors that historically are considered to be the most-shielded from high inflation and high interest rates. We then cross-referenced our coverage universe for companies where our analysts recently raised target prices; that have an Argus Financial Strength rating of at least Medium-High; and that pay dividends of least 3%. Some companies also are featured in our model portfolios (Growth & Income, Equity Income, Growth, and Institutional).

Though equities recovered, the U.S. economy is about to slow down and COVID-19 cases are rising again as virus variants spread. Volatility, which has dropped from the highs of 2020, still has not returned to pre-COVID levels.  Daily prices can swing wildly, as they did three times in 2021 when stocks dropped 4%-5% in a matter of a few days. Is it time for investors to cash in their chips? We note that investors exit the stock market at their own peril, as long-term returns from equities consistently have outpaced long-term returns from other asset classes, such as fixed income and cash. As well, those returns are from eras when the 10-year Treasury bond yield was not sub-2.0%. So what's a potential equity strategy for investors amid all the uncertainty? Argus believes that Min Vol is an all-weather strategy that is timely in any investing climate. Academic literature and, more to the point, returns history indicate that Min Vol can deliver market-matching returns on an absolute basis and superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis over various time periods.",

The primary driver of GDP over the next few quarters is likely to be the country's physical health, as the nation recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. Trends here have been slightly more positive in recent weeks, as the fourth wave of the pandemic, due largely to the Delta variant of COVID-19, may be past its peak. The domestic employment environment is in better shape than it was a year ago, though still far from full strength -- and it has weakened recently due to the Delta variant. Auto sales have recovered, but inventories are low due to bottlenecks. And the housing market, which had been strong in 1H21, is starting to cool as house prices soar. Rolling all the data up, and taking into account rising COVID cases as well as emerging supply chain issues and inventory levels, our GDP model now calls for 4.2% increase in GDP in 3Q21. We expect better growth in 4Q, too, before rates fall somewhat more sharply in 2022. On an annual basis, we look for overall GDP growth of approximately 5.8% in 2021 and 3.7% in 2022.

As we do each month, we have reviewed more than 25 important demographic and economic data points, from all sectors of the economy including consumer, housing, automotive, manufacturing and exports, among others. We also pay close attention to Federal Reserve activity, oil prices, the dollar, and trends in COVID-19. Rolling all the data up, and looking out two years, our GDP model now calls for 5.3% increase in GDP in 3Q21, down from our earlier forecast of 5.8%.  We expect good growth in 4Q as well, before rates fall more sharply in 2022. On an annual basis, we look for overall GDP growth of approximately 6.0 % in 2021 and 3.7% in 2022. Our estimates are consistent with consensus forecasts and the outlook from the Federal Reserve, which call for growth of 4%-7% in 2021. The GDPNow Forecast from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is 5.3% for 3Q21.  For more details of the trends inthis data and our assumptions, see the Argus Viewpoint report.",

While a recent rally in growth stocks has narrowed the performance advantage for value in the year to date, an environment of historically low interest rates is one in which many investors are still searching for high levels of income -- which often can be found in value stocks. When we look for attractive high-yield/deep-value stocks at Argus, we look for low valuations on metrics such as price/earnings, price/sales, price/book, yield, and price/cash flow. We also look for companies with clean balance sheets, high levels of profitability, high-quality earnings, and experienced management teams. We seek to avoid companies in industries that are in secular decline, or with dividend yields that are so high that the payout is clearly at risk. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have designed a portfolio of companies that are BUY-rated at Argus Research, have a Financial Strength rating of at least Medium, and have a yield of 3.0% or higher.",

The profit recovery from the depths of the pandemic low in 2Q20 was been swift, with earnings growth of 93% in 2Q21, according to Refinitiv. But earnings do not look good just on a relative basis -- the $53.93 projected to be earned by S&P 500 companies for the second quarter is the highest ever for the index. Investors can now turn their attention to the third quarter, when earnings are expected to rise a still-strong 30% year-over-year.  Our analysts are always on the lookout for companies that raise their outlooks during earnings season.  Management's ability to \"raise guidance\" can often be a catalyst to strong returns in the quarters ahead.  Here are 20 BUY-rated companies in Argus coverage for which management has raised guidance or increased its outlook during the 2Q21 EPS reporting season.",

Daily prices can swing wildly, as they did during two consecutive days in mid-July when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 1,000 points. Yet investors exit the stock market at their own peril, as long-term returns from equities consistently have outpaced long-term returns from other asset classes.

But in an environment of historically low interest rates (and with the coronavirus and economic shutdown seemingly poised to keep them low for a long time), many investors are still searching for high levels of income, which can often be found in value stocks. Progress on COVID-19 vaccines has given a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy companies and regional banks) that have lagged in recent quarters, and value stocks have kept up the pace with growth stocks in the past quarter. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.5%, compared to the 1.0% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF.  This is not unimportant, as the current yield on the 10-year Treasury bond is 0.95%.",

            "reportTitle": "The onset of the coronavirus earlier this year knocked the stock market into a bear market.  Though stocks have recovered, the U.S. economy is still in recession and COVID-19 cases are spiking as the weather turns colder and people head indoors.  Volatility, which was low in early 2020 after a robust year for equities in 2019, has spiked higher, and has remained elevated. Is it time to cash in the chips?  We note that investors exit the stock market at their own peril, as long-term returns from equities consistently have outpaced long-term returns from other asset classes such as fixed income and cash. As well, those returns are from eras when the 10-year Treasury bond yield was not sub-1.0%.  So what's a potential equity strategy for investors amid all the uncertainty? Argus believes that Min Vol is an all-weather strategy that is timely in any investing climate. Academic literature and, more to the point returns history, indicate that Min Vol can deliver market-matching returns on an absolute basis and superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis over various time periods.  Stocks included in our Min Vol model portfolio and typically industry leaders and have received a high score from our A6 Quant Model on Financial Strength and a low score on Risk. Stocks in the portfolio include the following.",

With interest rates near all-time lows, bond yields are below fair value and bond prices are well above fair value. Our model takes into account current levels and forecasts of bond yields, inflation, stock prices, GDP and corporate earnings. Generally, the model has done a good job of highlighting value. For example, stocks were very attractive compared to bonds in the late 1970s, when benchmark Treasury rates were in the high teens before heading consistently lower over recent decades. The model indicated that stocks were at a sharp premium to fair value prior to the \"dot-com\" crash of 2001 and at a premium prior to the Great Recession in 2007-2009. Starting in 2009, the model favored stocks -- another good call, until 1Q20. The model is not perfect: it failed to call the pandemic. But it has responded to the changes in prices, rates and EPS forecasts, and it still suggests that stocks are the more attractively valued asset class with the S&P 500 priced 10% below its all-time high.",
