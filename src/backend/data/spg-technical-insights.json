Indeed, for the past decade, the performance record has favored growth. Since 2010, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed more than 500%, compared to an advance of almost 300% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In eight of the past 10 years, growth stocks have topped value stocks. That hasn't always been the case. In the 2000-2010 decade, which included two bear markets and the Great Recession, value stocks were better performers than growth stocks, advancing an admittedly low 8% -- but still better than growth, which declined 15% during the decade. Value investors trace their roots to the famous \"Security Analysis\" textbook, written in 1934 (the year Argus Research was founded) by Ben Graham, an economics professor at Columbia University. Warren Buffett was one of his students. Looking ahead, the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has given a lift to some of the cyclical companies that have lagged in recent years, and value stocks outpaced growth stocks in the past year. Now, the Federal Reserve is lifting interest rates to fend off inflation, which likely will cap multiple expansion for growth companies. In any event, value is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.2%, compared to the 0.9% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF. For our list this week, we have screened our coverage universe for stocks that are BUY-rated by Argus Research analysts, have a Financial Strength rating of at least Medium, and have a yield of 4.0% or higher.

Now, with earnings season drawing to a close and insiders starting to trade again, the rubber meets the road.  Have insiders turned cautious or is their trading activity showing the enthusiasm that was in place ahead of earnings? Vickers' current short-term data (one-week) has calmed noticeably after a negative low-volume spike last week. Vickers' long-term data (eight-weeks) also is positive, with 11 of 16 recent measurements bullish and five neutral. Finally, the characteristics of this week's data are positive. The total number of insider sales transactions this week is down 16% since last week, while the total number of purchase transactions is up 28%. Heading into the final weeks of 2022, insiders are telling us that stocks seem well positioned to claw back more of the year-to-date losses.

            "reportTitle": "Stock-market volatility has increased of late, leaving corporate insiders as whipsawed as any other investor. In the past few months, we've had weeks in which stocks pulled back. The insider-trading data from Vickers Stock Research tells us that insiders consistently used those weeks to swoop in and pick up shares. In follow-on weeks, when stocks stabilized near all-time highs, insiders pulled back on buying. Based on recent sell/buy data from Vickers, insiders remain more bullish than bearish. Vickers' benchmark NYSE/ASE One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is currently 2.47. That's a neutral reading (improved from bearish last week); represents a third consecutive week of sentiment improvement; and compares very favorably to the 4.05 one-week ratio printed in early September. The NYSE/ASE eight-week moving average is 3.06 compared to 4.73 in mid-July. Overall, insider sentiment maintains a positive trend as the historically brutal month of September draws to a close and the historically positive last quarter of the year lies ahead.",

But in an environment of historically low interest rates (and with the Federal Reserve seemingly poised to cut again), many investors are still searching for high levels of income, which can often be found in value stocks. When we look for attractive high-yield/value stocks at Argus, we look for low valuations on metrics such as price/earnings, price/sales, price/book, yield and price/cash flow. But we also look for companies with clean balance sheets, high levels of profitability, cash-flow generation, and an experienced management teams. We seek to avoid companies in industries that are in secular decline, or with dividend yields that are so high that the payout is clearly at risk. That said, many value companies may face a substantial near-term industry problem. That might be a retailer fending off Amazon.com; or an energy company tied to the uncertain long-term outlook for demand for fossil fuels; or a newspaper company in the digital advertising age. Some value companies, such as tobacco companies, may face ongoing legal or regulatory risks. And others may be facing problems such as over-aggressive acquisitions, patent expirations or recent earnings stumbles. Based on requests from clients, we have designed a portfolio of companies followed by Argus Research that are BUY- or HOLD-rated on a long-term (five-year) basis and have an average yield of 4.0% or higher.",
