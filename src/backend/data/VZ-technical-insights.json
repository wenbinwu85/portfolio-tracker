That's a recent rarity, as for more than a decade, the performance record favored growth. Since 2010, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed more than 575%, compared to an advance of almost 200% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In 10 of the past 13 years, growth stocks have topped value stocks.  That hasn't always been the case. In the 2000-2010 decade, including the Great Recession, value stocks were better performers than growth stocks, advancing an admittedly low 8% (but still better than growth, which declined 15% during the decade). Value investors trace their roots to the famous \"Security Analysis\" textbook, written by Ben Graham, an economics professor at Columbia University.  Warren Buffett was one of his students. Why the recent deviation in performance? Several reasons, including changes in the make-up of the economy, growth in intangible assets, and the current level of interest rates. But the tide turned back in 2022, at least for a while, as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines gave a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy and regional banks) that had lagged in recent years. While growth stocks have recaptured the lead since 2023, the Federal Reserve continues to keep interest rates high to fend off inflation. This could possibly cap multiple expansion for growth companies in coming quarters. In any event, the value sector is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.0%, compared to the 0.7% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF.

Looking at 13F filings of big institutional portfolios, we see that the big guns were busy last quarter taking advantage of that dip. Citadel Advisors went on a buying spree, adding to its $100 billion portfolio across a range of sectors. As did D.E. Shaw, adding to its $67 billion portfolio. Vickers Stock Research, a subsidiary of Argus Research Group, analyzes insider trading and institutional stock ownership. Form 13-Fs, which institutions must file to report their holdings, are due 45 days after the end of calendar quarters and have come in for 4Q24. We review 13Fs of major activists to determine core holdings and new purchases. Activist investing is now less about generating a short-term return and more about achieving long-term returns through an active management/investor partnership. Based on data from Vickers, here are some recent new purchases and key holdings of activist investors, as well as other high-profile money managers.",

The continued stress on the economy from higher interest rates, and questions about whether the Federal Reserve is done raising them, have weighed on valuations. Most economists are not convinced that the recession question has been answered. While there are strengths in the economy -- like the labor market and consumer spending -- inflation indicators inched up last month. The uncertain environment has impacted small-caps, mid-caps, large-caps, and even mega-caps. There is a wide range in data that shows how sectors are weathering this climate, with Communication Services up nearly 40% year-to-date but Consumer Staples down 2% for the same time period. In our opinion, some solid companies with strong financials have been oversold. For our list this week, we identified 10 BUY-rated large- or mega-cap companies across numerous industries that are selling at attractive valuations (more than 20% below their 52-week highs). They are listed according to company size, with the largest first.",

Indeed, for the past decade, the performance record has favored growth. Since 2010, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed more than 500%, compared to an advance of almost 300% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In eight of the past 10 years, growth stocks have topped value stocks. That hasn't always been the case. In the 2000-2010 decade, which included two bear markets and the Great Recession, value stocks were better performers than growth stocks, advancing an admittedly low 8% -- but still better than growth, which declined 15% during the decade. Value investors trace their roots to the famous \"Security Analysis\" textbook, written in 1934 (the year Argus Research was founded) by Ben Graham, an economics professor at Columbia University. Warren Buffett was one of his students. Looking ahead, the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has given a lift to some of the cyclical companies that have lagged in recent years, and value stocks outpaced growth stocks in the past year. Now, the Federal Reserve is lifting interest rates to fend off inflation, which likely will cap multiple expansion for growth companies. In any event, value is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.2%, compared to the 0.9% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF. For our list this week, we have screened our coverage universe for stocks that are BUY-rated by Argus Research analysts, have a Financial Strength rating of at least Medium, and have a yield of 4.0% or higher.

We note that investors exit the stock market at their own peril, as long-term returns from equities consistently have outpaced long-term returns from other asset classes, such as fixed income and cash. As well, those fixed-income returns are from eras when the 10-year Treasury bond yield was much higher than the current 3.5% level.

The broad retrenchment has dragged down small-caps, mid-caps, large-caps, and even the mega-caps that had previously pushed stocks to new heights as the economy recovered from the pandemic.

These are the strongest and most-stable stocks in each sector -- and by looking across sectors, diversification can also be achieved. To get our list this week, we ran multiple screens. We started with the Argus Min-Vol theme model portfolio. As the name suggests, that portfolio includes companies that likely can best withstand market fluctuations. We then shortlisted the group by also screening for financial strength and dividend yield. And, finally, we picked one stock from each of the 11 S&P sectors. The following stocks are our Best in Class for Safety recommendations for September 2022, and all of them currently carry an Argus BUY rating.",

Indeed, for the past decade, the performance record has favored growth. Since 2010, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed more than 600%, compared to an advance of 300% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In nine of the past 10 years, growth stocks have topped value stocks. That wasn't always the case. In the 2000-2010 decade, which included two bear markets and the Great Recession, value stocks were better performers than growth stocks, advancing an admittedly low 8% (but still better than growth, which declined 15% during the decade). Value investors trace their roots to the famous \"Security Analysis\" textbook, written by Ben Graham, an economics professor at Columbia University. Warren Buffett was one of his students. Looking ahead, the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines has given a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy companies and regional banks) that have lagged in recent quarters, and value stocks have kept up the pace with growth stocks in the past year. Now, the Federal Reserve is lifting interest rates to fend off inflation, which will likely cap multiple expansion for growth companies. In any event, value is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.1%, compared to the 0.8% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF. For our list this week, we have screened our coverage universe for stocks that are BUY-rated at Argus Research, have an Argus Financial Strength rating of at least Medium, and have a yield of 4.0% or higher.

Plenty of other giants report this week including Coca-Cola (KO), Chipotle (CMG), General Electric (GE), General Motors (GM), Boeing (BA), Exxon Mobil (XOM, Chevron (CVX), and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) among many others. The range of companies will give more data points on how different sectors are weathering the many external factors out there including - inflation, rising interest rates, and the continued war in Ukraine including economic sanctions on Russia. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial average was down 640 points or 1.9%, the S&P 500 fell 2.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite was hit the hardest, losing 3.8%. Year-to-date, the Dow is down 7%, the S&P 500 is now in correction territory, off 10.4%, and the Nasdaq digs deeper into correction territory, down 17.9%. On Friday, the Dow suffered its worst one-day point loss since October 2020, shedding 981 points or 2.8%, the S&P 500 lost 2.8%, and the Nasdaq fell 2.6%. It was a rough week. ",

Now, the Federal Reserve is poised to lift interest rates to fend off inflation, which will likely cap multiple expansion for growth companies. Regardless, the value sector is the place to achieve income.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the debt/GDP ratio was in the 30%-40% range, and moved up toward the 60% level by 2000. The debt level soared around 2010, as the government spent aggressively to halt the Great Recession and rekindle growth. (According to Keynes, that's what the government is supposed to do). Still, despite more than 10 years of economic growth prior to the pandemic, debt only increased as a percentage of GDP.  And now, in light of the fiscal spending to fight the impact of COVID-19, debt levels have surged. This is not a problem that has to be fixed today. After all, interest rates are low on an historical basis and policies to change the trajectory (less spending, more taxes) could push the economy back into decline. But politicians should start to establish a plan to address the issue in the next 10-15 years. If the problem is not solved, the situation could result in hyperinflation and a weak dollar, which would send interest rates higher and cut into equity valuations.",

While a recent rally in growth stocks has narrowed the performance advantage for value in the year to date, an environment of historically low interest rates is one in which many investors are still searching for high levels of income -- which often can be found in value stocks. When we look for attractive high-yield/deep-value stocks at Argus, we look for low valuations on metrics such as price/earnings, price/sales, price/book, yield, and price/cash flow. We also look for companies with clean balance sheets, high levels of profitability, high-quality earnings, and experienced management teams. We seek to avoid companies in industries that are in secular decline, or with dividend yields that are so high that the payout is clearly at risk. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have designed a portfolio of companies that are BUY-rated at Argus Research, have a Financial Strength rating of at least Medium, and have a yield of 3.0% or higher.",

Total U.S. debt is now more than 120% of GDP, according to the Office of Management & the Budget. That is the highest level since World War II. In the 1980s, the debt/GDP ratio was solidly in the 40% range, and moved up toward 60% by 2000. The debt level soared around 2010, as the government spent aggressively to brake the recession and rekindle growth. (According to Keynes, that's what the government is supposed to do.) Still, despite more than 10 years of economic growth prior to the pandemic, the debt level has only grown as a percentage of GDP. Now, in light of the fiscal spending to fight the impact of COVID-19, debt levels have surged. This is not a problem that has to be fixed today. After all, interest rates are low on an historical basis and policies to change the trajectory (less spending, more taxes) could push the economy into decline. But politicians should start to establish a plan to address the issue in the next 10-15 years. If not, the situation could result in hyperinflation or an inability for the government to address long-term problems such as rebuilding infrastructure or addressing climate change.",

But in an environment of historically low interest rates (and with the coronavirus and economic shutdown seemingly poised to keep them low for a long time), many investors are still searching for high levels of income, which can often be found in value stocks. Progress on COVID-19 vaccines has given a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy companies and regional banks) that have lagged in recent quarters, and value stocks have kept up the pace with growth stocks in the past quarter. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.5%, compared to the 1.0% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF.

As such, little attention is being paid to U.S. debt levels that have quietly and quickly grown over the past 10 years. Total U.S. debt is now more than 120% of GDP -- the highest level since World War II. In the 1980s, the debt/GDP ratio was solidly in the 40% range, and moved up toward the 60% level by 2000. The debt level soared around 2010, as the government spent aggressively to brake the recession and rekindle growth (which is what the government is supposed to do). However, despite more than 10 years of economic growth prior to the pandemic, the debt level has only grown as a percentage of GDP. Now, in light of the fiscal spending in 2020, debt levels have surged further. This is not a problem that has to be fixed today. After all, interest rates are low and policies to change the trajectory (less spending, more taxes) could push the economy deeper into recession. But politicians should start to establish a plan to address the issue in the next 10-15 years. If the problem is not solved, the situation could result in hyper-inflation or an inability for the government to address long-term problems such as rebuilding the infrastructure or climate change.",

Though stocks have recovered, the U.S. economy is still in recession and COVID-19 cases are spiking as the weather turns colder and people head indoors.  Volatility, which was low in early 2020 after a robust year for equities in 2019, has spiked higher, and has remained elevated. Is it time to cash in the chips?  We note that investors exit the stock market at their own peril, as long-term returns from equities consistently have outpaced long-term returns from other asset classes such as fixed income and cash. As well, those returns are from eras when the 10-year Treasury bond yield was not sub-1.0%.  So what's a potential equity strategy for investors amid all the uncertainty? Argus believes that Min Vol is an all-weather strategy that is timely in any investing climate. Academic literature and, more to the point returns history, indicate that Min Vol can deliver market-matching returns on an absolute basis and superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis over various time periods.  Stocks included in our Min Vol model portfolio and typically industry leaders and have received a high score from our A6 Quant Model on Financial Strength and a low score on Risk.

Simultaneously, internet giants Alphabet and Facebook are acting as forums for community concerns about the coronavirus. The style mix of the sector is approximately one-third \"value\" and two-thirds \"growth.\" The adjusted pro-forma beta is approximately 1.0 (like the old Telecoms), while the yield is 0.9% (reflecting the impact of Google and Facebook).  The smoothed growth rate is 7% and the P/E ratio is 21-times. The sector accounts for 11% of the S&P 500.

But in an environment of historically low interest rates (and with the coronavirus and economic shutdown seemingly poised to keep them low for a long time), many investors are still searching for high levels of income, which can often be found in value stocks. When we look for attractive high-yield/value stocks at Argus, we look for low valuations on metrics such as price/earnings, price/sales, price/book, yield and price/cash flow. But we also look for companies with clean balance sheets, high levels of profitability, cash-flow generation, and an experienced management teams. We seek to avoid companies in industries that are in secular decline, or with dividend yields that are so high that the payout is clearly at risk. To us, right now, that level is 8%-9%-plus. That said, many value companies may face a substantial near-term industry problem. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have designed a portfolio of companies followed by Argus Research analysts that are BUY-rated on a long-term (five-year) basis, have a Financial Strength rating of at least Medium, and have a yield of 3.5% or higher.",
