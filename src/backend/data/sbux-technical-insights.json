In some decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for 15%-20% of returns. Still, in 2018, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates.

This generation is the largest in history - bigger than even the Baby Boomers. Yet despite their size, and according to our research, Millennials currently account for 25% of total U.S income - some $3.1 trillion in direct annual purchasing power. Millennials are already coveted by marketers, even though their annual average income is 40% below the spending levels of the generation ahead of them (Gen X) and 30% below the spending levels of Baby Boomers, who are slowing down.
