            "reportTitle": "Dividend income is often overlooked amid gyrations in the stock market. But dividends are an important element of return.  Dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks. High-yield stocks typically have dividends that pay out in the 5%-8% range. Though the income appears attractive, the share prices of high-yield stocks may be at risk.  Dividend-growth stocks typically have lower yields, often in the 1.0%-2.5% range. But the lower-yielding dividends are not likely to be a huge component of cash flow, leaving management teams with other value-additive options for deploying cash. Further, while the yields are not as high, management teams may be more likely to boost the payouts over time, as earnings grow.",

Major stock indices continue to rise and insider-sentiment indicators from Vickers Stock Research continue to fall. That said, the current action is well within historical norms; it tells us that insiders likely don't see much low-hanging fruit and that the recent run higher in stocks may be getting a bit frothy. But it doesn't suggest it is time to run for the exits. Vickers' broadest sentiment reading, the Total Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio, is currently 2.45 and still within the neutral territory between 2.00 and 2.50. Since early October, the ratio has floated in the neutral zone and, like now, has flirted several time with a break into bearish territory above 2.50. But so far, it has not. On an exchange basis, the NYSE eight-week remains neutral at 2.37, while the Nasdaq eight-week has pushed into bearish territory with a reading of 2.61. But considering the Nasdaq's significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, we aren't shocked that insiders on the exchange are taking some money off the table.",

Alphabet lost a steep 10% in one day last week after investors expressed their disappointment over growth in its cloud business. That same day, Microsoft surged after reporting better-than-expected growth in its Azure OpenAI cloud service. The race is on, and some will win and some will lose along the way. But the potential pie is big. In the internet era, in which digital commerce complements or has supplanted physical commerce, the information technology needs of all enterprises have grown. The traditional on-premises approach has been rendered inefficient, given that a user's IT needs may fluctuate at any time. Into this void, the Cloud has arrived. In Cloud services models, an enterprise's IT needs can be matched and scaled in real time. Through the Cloud, enterprises consume only as much computing, storage, and networking bandwidth as they need. For a major event, this allows massive scaling of IT resources beyond the restraints of on-premises implementation. For periods in which operations are steady, the Cloud services model allows for a needs-only application. The leading providers of Cloud services tend to be large Technology and Communication Services companies that provide many goods and services distinct from or adjacent to their Cloud businesses. Growth has been impressive for this group. Collectively, participants in the Cloud eco-system grew revenue at a 19% compound annual growth rate from 2016 to 2022. Still, the line isn't straight up.  While Cloud services grew at a 23% growth rate from 2020 to 2021, the average growth rate slowed to 15.3% for 2022.  This slowdown in revenue growth reflected impediments to normal business activity from the supply-chain crisis, inflation, and rising interest rates. Even so, demand for Cloud services has held up relatively well, given that Cloud transition is a long-tailed process and that Cloud transformation has become an imperative. Here is a list of U.S.-based companies followed by Argus and that we think are in position to take advantage of this secular trend.",

            "reportTitle": "The growth prospects for the artificial intelligence (AI) universe are impressive, yet hard to determine. Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of the major publicly-traded players and most of the mid-tier players, along with our industry analysts' knowledge of private players. We estimate the global AI industry amounted to about $90-$100 billion in 2021, and expect it to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when it is expected to reach $1.8 trillion in annual revenue. We expect annual growth to decelerate from the low- to mid-40% range in immediate years to the mid-30% range for years toward the end of the survey period. But determining a realistic estimate for the size of the industry is a challenge. Even for an industry that promises to redefine measuring tools, there is no measurable unit of AI output comparable to barrels of oil or tons of steel. As well, much of AI development occurs within labs and at universities, and the output is measured in tangible progress against objectives, not dollars or units of output. In the corporate world, nearly all the AI pure-play companies service micro-niches, have little measurable revenue, and are deeply unprofitable. For our list this week, we take a big picture view of three areas where AI applications are developing. In Big Tech, we believe much of the revenue and most of the profitability from AI is attributable to several giant U.S. and a few international companies that operate primarily in growth sectors such as Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary. Next, we note that China is also a hub of AI development, with companies like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent (though Argus follows only Alibaba). Finally, Niche Tech has significant AI activity among companies pursuing advances in IoT, vehicle electrification, autonomous driving, automation and connectivity solutions for manufacturing, warehousing, construction, and other areas. Here are featured companies followed by Argus in those three categories.",

            "reportTitle": "Argus Research believes that ESG investing is a smart option to consider. Companies committed to ESG values typically reflect positive traits from management which often translate into better business. ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investing has come a long way and continues to grow. According to the Global Sustainable Investment Association, global assets under management in ESG strategies were $40 trillion in 2020, up from $23 trillion in 2016 and on track for $50 trillion by 2025. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. But performance of these initial strategies lagged. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across industries that have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. At Argus Research, we track ESG progress at specific companies as part of our Management analysis -- one of the six points in our proprietary Six-Point System for fundamental research. In addition to reviewing and measuring the ESG proclamations from companies under coverage, we partner with an ESG research firm, JUST Capital, and leverage its analysis and insights. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public. JUST utilizes a combination of data-driven research and strategic engagement in an attempt to shift norms and practices in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST ESG Custom Ratings rank stocks in the Russell 1000 on criteria using a scale of 1-100. Drawing on the JUST Capital rankings, we have compiled focused lists of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have a \"sustainable impact\" on the environment, workplace, community, and marketplace. These firms have exemplary records of delivering on the bottom line, and also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We also have a theme model portfolio based in part on ESG criteria. To build the Argus U.S. ESG Theme Model Portfolio, we apply financial concepts such as industry diversification, income generation, risk reduction, and growth at a reasonable price to our various lists. In addition, all stocks must be on the Argus BUY list. For more on JUST Capital's criteria, please visit the JUST Capital website, www.justcapital.com. For more information on the Argus companies, please see our Analyst Reports at www.argusresearch.com. Here are some of the stocks that are currently in the Argus U.S. ESG Theme Model Portfolio.",

No one is very focused on the broad market index's 1.6% current yield. But dividends are an important element of return. Dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. In 2018, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices declined as the Fed hiked rates. The pattern was repeated in 2022. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.",

BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $9 trillion in assets, announced in January 2020 that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.",

The sector is outperforming the market thus far in 2023, with a gain of 12.4%. Tech underperformed the market in 2022, with a loss of 28.9%, and outperformed in 2021, with a gain of 33.4%.

In some decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for 15%-20% of returns. Still, in 2018, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. The pattern was repeated in 2022 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.",

He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.",

This week, we used the Argus Screening Tool to find a list of companies that appear to be low risk, have strong balance sheets, and seemingly represent undervalued opportunities. Specifically, we screened the Argus Universe of Coverage for companies with a BUY rating, a market cap over $8 billion, and with a HIGH financial strength rating from Argus. Then we sorted for those furthest away from their Argus 12-month target price (suggesting a deep discount).

But when the ratios from Vickers drop, good things often follow. Insiders typically sell shares 2.0- to 2.5-times more often than they buy shares. As such, the neutral range for the sell/buy ratios is 2.00 to 2.50; above 2.50 is bearish territory; and below 2.00 is bullish land. Ratios below 1.00 represent rarified territory, as they occur only when insiders are buying shares more often than they are selling. And that is where things are headed this week. ",

The blended (actual for those reporting and consensus for those still to report) growth rate is 6.2%, near the 5.6% expectation and indicating the \"beats\" have not been robust. But the sour mood coming into the quarter is being greeted with relief that profit shortfalls and lowered guidance are not rampant. Our analysts always look for companies that boost outlooks during earnings season. Raising guidance can be a catalyst for strong returns in the quarters ahead.

Even bond prices are lower year-to-date. Volatility, which has dropped from the highs of 2020, still has not returned to pre-COVID levels. Is it time for investors to cash in their chips?  Perhaps not yet.  We note that investors exit the stock market at their own peril, as long-term returns from equities consistently have outpaced long-term returns from other asset classes, such as fixed income and cash. As well, those returns are from eras when the 10-year Treasury bond yield was much higher than the current 3.0% level. So what's a potential equity strategy for investors amid all the uncertainty? Argus believes that Min-Vol is an all-weather strategy that is timely in any investing climate. Academic literature and, more to the point, returns history indicate that Min-Vol can deliver market-matching returns on an absolute basis and superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis over various time periods. We have designed a portfolio of companies followed by Argus Research analysts that are BUY-rated and have impressive Min-Vol characteristics of low beta, high yield, high market cap, strong balance sheets, and low risk profiles. Some of the stocks featured in the portfolio are listed below.",

In some decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for 15%-20% of returns. Still, in 2018, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. The pattern is being repeated in 2022 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.",

The third factor is especially important as the pandemic upended the nation's recent record of long-term economic growth.

He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.",

Corporate bond yields have meanwhile declined, as investors are now more optimistic about the potential for lower default rates. As a consequence, spreads between corporate and Treasury bond yields have continued to narrow.  The spread between AAA-rated corporate bonds and 10-year government bonds in December was 66 basis points, below the 35-year average of 108 bps and down 20 bps from August. The gap between the government 10-year bond yield and a BAA-rated bond (still investment grade) in December was 172 basis points, below the historical average spread of 232 bps and down more than 20 basis points from August.   From a risk-management standpoint, we watch these spreads closely to gauge the bond market's view of corporate financial strength, which appears to be improving given the narrowing spreads. From an investment standpoint, we think that corporate bonds are prices above fair value, and in this environment favor inflation-indexed fixed-income securities such as TIPs.",

This third factor is especially important as the pandemic upends the nation's recent record of long-term economic growth.

In some decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for 15%-20% of returns. Still, in 2018, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates.

Two-thirds of the world will have internet access by 2023, while the number of connected devices is expected to grow to three-times the global population. IoT (machine to machine or M2M) connections are expected to grow at a 30% CAGR. Security is a top need, as \"denial of service\" attacks are set to double by 2023. To handle the challenges of managing, storing, and securing data amid this explosive traffic growth, data centers will need to harness the power of artificial intelligence. AI enhances data center capabilities though the power of machine learning, inference, and deep learning, all in an application-accelerated environment. The AI data center also makes use of non-traditional and emerging technologies that provide more computing power than traditional CPU-based architectures. These include GPU Compute from NVidia and Tensor cores from Google/Alphabet. As of mid-year 2021, about 600 hyperscale data centers were in operation around the world, up from about 500 at year-end 2019 and double the number from five years ago. The bulk of data center construction is by hyperscale providers including AWS from Amazon.com, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud from Alphabet, as well as with Chinese companies including Baidu and Alibaba. Co-location companies are another major data center driver, including Equinix and Digital Realty Trust. International Business Machines is providing hybrid cloud services that bridge public and private clouds. Other data center suppliers include semiconductor companies Broadcom, Marvell Technology, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices.

            "reportTitle": "Sustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction with the global investment community. In January 2020, BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $9 trillion in assets, announced that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. But the performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.",

The sector is the largest in the U.S. market and now accounts for more than 28% of the S&P 500. Over the long term, we expect the sector to benefit from pervasive digitization across the economy, greater acceptance of transformative technologies, and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Healthy company and sector fundamentals are also positive. For individual companies, these include high cash levels, low debt, and broad international business exposure. We have an Over-Weight ranking on the Tech sector and think investors should look to allocate up to 30% of their diversified portfolios to the group.  Here is how we use our analysts' Tech sector ideas in our Focus List and Model Portfolios.",

Daily prices can swing wildly, as they did during two consecutive days in mid-July when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 1,000 points. Yet investors exit the stock market at their own peril, as long-term returns from equities consistently have outpaced long-term returns from other asset classes.

According to Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, global assets under management in ESG strategies grew to $40.5 trillion in 2020, doubling in four years and tripling in eight. As assets have flowed in, SRI investing has evolved over the past 40 years. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all businesses that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as workers' rights, poverty, hunger, and the climate. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have compiled a portfolio of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of \"sustainable impact\" on the environment, workplace, and community. These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We built our portfolio by identifying companies that are BUY-rated by Argus analysts and also score well on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria established by the JUST Capital Foundation. JUST Capital utilizes a combination of polling, data-driven research, and strategic engagement to shift behaviors and activities in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric, inclusive form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public.  JUST ranks the Russell 1000 on these criteria against a scale of 1-100. Here are company highlights from the Argus U.S. ESG Model Portfolio.",

            "reportTitle": "The Commerce Department has reported that 1Q21 GDP rose at a 6.4% rate -- in line with the advance estimate announced last month. As we typically do for the second estimate, let's take a closer look at the key contributing sectors to GDP. First, the Consumer. During 1Q, personal consumption expenditures grew at an 11% pace and contributed 60.8% of core demand (which we define as personal consumption expenditures, equipment and intellectual property spending, housing, exports and government expenditures). This is in line with the 10-year average, as the consumer sector, which is the most-important component of the economy, is continuing to recover from the impact of the pandemic.  Capital investments into equipment rose 13% and accounted for a consistent 5.3% of total GDP, while capital investments into intellectual property rose 17% and accounted for a high 4.4% of total GDP, compared to the historical average of 3.7%. Exports remained under pressure (accounting of 9.3% of total demand compared to historical average of 10.8%) as did government (accounting for 15.9% of total demand compared to historical average of 16.5%). It is our thesis that as U.S. GDP recovers to pre-COVID-19 levels, various sectors will recover at different paces. We look for consumer spending and capital investments into IP to be among the leading contributors to recovery.",

Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for 15%-20% of returns. Still, in 2018, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.",
