In February, headline PPI rose 0.6%, up from 0.2% in January and ahead of the expected 0.3% increase -- with nearly two-thirds of the increase attributed to a rise in prices for final-demand goods. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that sales in January were down 1.3%. Leading the decline were merchant wholesalers (-1.7%), while retailer sales slipped 1.1%, and manufacturer sales declined 1.0%. Inventories were essentially flat, as a 0.4% rise in retail inventories was offset by a 0.3% drop in merchant wholesaler and 0.1% decline in manufacturer inventories. Initial jobless claims for the week were 209,000, down 1,000 from the previous-week's revised level. The Dow fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 was down 0.3%, and the Nasdaq lost 0.3%. Crude oil traded above $81 per barrel, while gold fell $13 to $2167 per ounce.",

Still, there are individual names we like and there is a trend of consolidation in the sector, all of which has piqued our interest. Exxon Mobil is buying Pioneer Natural and Chevron is buying Hess. We think this might prompt other big oil companies to look around as well. We think Conoco Phillips could be in the market to scoop up a smaller company (possibly Devon, EOG, or Marathon Oil). We don't think there will be any regulatory hurdles, as consolidation could lead oil prices to retreat, which would help the overall U.S. economy as inflation is still high in many areas. So it would seem to be in the government's interest to allow these deals to go through. Energy accounts for only about 3%-4% of total S&P 500 capitalization, but the sector often acts as a hedge to the broader market -- so having exposure to the group is important. Energy tends to zigs when the S&P 500 zags.  Indeed, in 2022, the S&P 500 declined 19.4% while the Energy sector advanced 59%.  In the August-October period of 2023, the S&P 500 fell more than 8% while the Energy sector declined only 3%. The following is a list of names we like overall in both Oil and Energy.",

The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles to a large degree - have moved overseas, where labor and materials costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, even during the pandemic and the current period of high inflation, has expanded to record levels. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products (such as vaccines) and services (such as Zoom calls) and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not be growing, and capital would not be flooding into the country. The current high level of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies around the world attests to the confidence that global investors have in the innovative U.S. economy.",

The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, even during the pandemic, has expanded to record levels. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products (such as vaccines) and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not be growing, and capital would not be flooding into the country. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but was more than $24 trillion at the end of 2021. That's growth of 24-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than three-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven, in large part, by innovation.",

As for small-caps, the promise of the vaccine is encouraging for these companies, which typically don't have the gilt-edged balance sheets of large-caps and are thus more dependent on a strong U.S. economy.

According to Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, global assets under management in ESG strategies had grown to $40.5 trillion in 2020, doubling in four years and tripling in eight years. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. For our part, we track ESG developments at specific companies as part of our Management analysis - one of the six points in our proprietary Six-Point Fundamental Approach. In addition to following the ESG proclamations from the companies under coverage, we partner with an ESG research firm, the JUST Capital Foundation, and leverage its analysis and insights as well. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric, inclusive form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public. JUST utilizes a combination of data-driven research and strategic engagement in an attempt to shift norms and practices in corporate America and the financial markets. Environment, and Shareholders. JUST ESG Custom Ratings rank stocks in the Russell 1000 on these criteria using a scale of 1-100. Drawing on the JUST Capital rankings, we have compiled focused lists of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of \"sustainable impact\" on the environment, workplace, community, and marketplace. These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We have lists focused on the top companies in each sector, as well as lists of companies that score well on certain financial metrics, such as yield, beta, value, and momentum. We also have a Theme Model Portfolio based in part on the ESG criteria. To build the Argus U.S. ESG Model Portfolio, we applied financial concepts such as industry diversification, income generation, risk reduction and growth at a reasonable price to our various lists. In addition, all stocks must be on the Argus BUY list. Here are the new stocks that have been added to the Argus U.S. ESG Model Portfolio.",

Given low interest rates, we expect growth stocks to resume their outperformance over time, and think this may be the one-in-five years that value leads. Investors seeking value are encouraged to focus on dividends and look for yields in the 3%-4% range. As for small-caps, the promise of the vaccine is encouraging for these companies, which typically don't have the gilt-edged balance sheets of large-caps and are thus more dependent on a strong U.S. economy. Small-cap valuations remain depressed, and this group looks to offer value into 2022.",

In an interview on '60 Minutes,' Mr. Powell said he expected the U.S. economy to 'recover steadily' through the second half of the year assuming no second wave of the virus. However, he cautioned that the recovery could stretch through the end of 2021 and that a full recovery would likely require the development of a vaccine.
