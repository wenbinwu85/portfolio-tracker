The company is also likely to restore its dividend by the end of the year. PepsiCo shares rose following above-consensus 4Q earnings and the announcement of a 10% dividend hike. The Dow rose 0.3%, the S&P 0.3%, and the Nasdaq 0.4%. Crude oil fell 1% to $77.50 per barrel, while gold fell $6 to $1885 per ounce.",

The unemployment rate declined slightly to a cycle-low 3.4%.  Average hourly earnings increased 10 cents month-to-month and are now 4.4% higher year-over-year, up 30 basis points month-to-month. Revisions to the jobs totals in the two prior months added 71,000 jobs to the economy. In January, jobs gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, government, and healthcare.  Industries notably absent from the outsize-jobs-gains during the month include mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction, wholesale trade, and financial activities. December's jobs gains were revised to 260,000 from 223,000, suggesting the consumer segment of the economy may remain on a growth track for the next few months, despite the impact of the Federal Reserve rate hikes, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and low consumer-confidence readings.  The news on the inflation front may not have been as sanguine as many investors wanted. While wage growth is easing, it remains strong. Stock futures have been in the red all morning, and turned even lower after the report was released as it signals the Federal Reserve may not be able to end their rate increases as soon as bulls hoped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 3.5% from approximately 3.3% earlier this morning.",

There is no secret sauce, but there are principals that are worth reviewing: 1) diversify; 2) look for strong management; 3) look for solid balance sheets; 4) do your homework; and 5) adapt. To assemble this week's list, we looked across several sectors that historically are considered to be the most-shielded from high inflation and high interest rates. We then cross-referenced our coverage universe for companies where our analysts recently raised target prices; that have an Argus Financial Strength rating of at least Medium-High; and that pay dividends of least 3%.

Mr. Powell acknowledged that inflation was 'much too high' and said that the Fed was 'moving expeditiously to bring it back down.' The Dow fell 2.6%, the S&P 3.0%, and the Nasdaq 4.1%.

Turning to other data points, the unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percent to 4.0%, and the number of unemployed persons was up to 6.5 million from 6.3 million in December -- this as more people re-entered the work force. Average hourly earnings increased 23 cents month-to-month and are 5.7% higher year-over-year. Revisions to the two prior months added back a whopping 709,000 jobs to the economy, though we note the adjustments also reflect the Labor Department's annual benchmark process. In January, jobs gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, retail trade transportation and warehousing, construction, and manufacturing. The report (and especially the revisions) explains some inconsistencies to the December report that we highlighted last month and also indicates that the economy remains on a growth track -- even with the impact of the Omicron variant. The robust jobs numbers and high wage growth certainly feed into the narrative that the Federal Reserve will hike the fed funds rate at its March meeting.",

Our stock-market valuation model takes into account factors such as stock prices, five-year normalized earnings (three historical years, including the sharp drop during the pandemic, and two forward-looking), GDP, inflation, and T-bond and T-bill yields. We note that stocks rarely trade right at fair value. Since 1960, on average, the index has traded at a relatively tight 2.5% above fair value, but the standard deviation to the mean is 16%. As such, we normally expect the S&P 500 to trade between 14% undervalued and 18% overvalued. At current prices, the stock market is about 50% above fair value, implying that investors may be overly optimistic about equities in the coming months. Though we are still bullish on the economy, earnings, and continued historically low interest rates, we'd feel better about the longer-term outlook for stocks if valuations were not so stretched. Several factors could improve valuations: a pullback in stock prices (seemingly underway and which occurred three times in 2021); lower bond yields; or better earnings, which we expect to see during the current reporting season.",

He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. But the performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.",

The results were impressive -- but came against an easy comparison with last year's 1Q, when the world started to shut down to fight COVID-19.  Through early May, Refinitiv reported that S&P 500 earnings rose 50.4% year over year -- the best quarter since 1Q2010.  Some 87% of companies have come in ahead of expectations, up from the prior four-quarter average of 76%, according to Refinitiv.  Where is the growth? Consumer Discretionary remains atop the list with a 170% earnings increase. Financials is second at 130%. Only Industrials is expected to remain negative -- with a 2% decline. Even the Energy sector, expected to have an earnings decrease at the start of the quarter, is now poised for 8% growth. Our analysts are always on the lookout for companies that raise their outlooks during earnings season. Management's ability to \"raise guidance\" can often be a catalyst for strong returns in the quarters ahead. Here are 20 BUY-rated companies in Argus coverage at which management has raised guidance or increased its outlook during the 1Q21 EPS reporting season.",

In January 2020, BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $9 trillion in assets, announced that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. But the performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.",
